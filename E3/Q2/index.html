					<p>Ai Hoshino is a talented and beautiful idol who is adored by her fans. But all that glitters is not gold. 
					  Gorou Amemiya is a doctor and fan of Ai. So when the pregnant idol shows up at his hospital he promises her a safe delivery. 
					  Little does he know, an encounter with a mysterious figure would result in his untimely deathâ€”or so he thought. 
					  Opening his eyes in the lap of his beloved idol, Gorou finds that he has been reborn as her newborn son! With his world turned upside down, 
					  Gorou soon learns that the world of showbiz is paved with thorns, where talent does not always beget success. 
					  Will he manage to protect Ai's smile that he loves so much with the help of an eccentric and unexpected ally?</p>

					  <p>Crimson Magic Clan members Megumin and Yunyun are at the top of their class, but they still have a lot to learn. 
						Yunyun's begun learning advanced magic, but Megumin has gone down a different path-the path of explosion magic! 
						Despite being warned of its limited usefulness, Megumin believes explosion magic is the way for her to become a great, 
						voluptuous wizard, and she won't be convinced otherwise!</p>

					  <h3>Tengoku Daimakyou</h3>
					  <p>Within the safety of the walls, youths are raised in a nursery-style setting by robots. While life there may appear stale on the surface, 
						the children are full of potential and curiosity. In many ways it is like a slice of heaven. The outside world is a hell-scape. 
						It is almost entirely void of anything mechanical and is now inhabited by bizarre, yet powerful super-natural beings.
						Maru, with the aid of Kiruko, is out there crisscrossing what was once Tokyo for heaven. But after searching for so long, 
						maybe heaven is more of an untenable dream than a potential reality.</p>

					  <p>Two months after the death of Upper Rank 6, the story begins with Tanjiro awoke from a coma. After a few days of recovery, 
						 Aoi told that Hotaru Haganezuka was tired of repairing Tanjiro's sword. Therefore, he will no longer repair it. 
						So Tanjiro travels to the Swordsmith Village with the help of Goto in order to replace his sword. 
						As Tanjiros's nose is so sharp, he is not only blind filled but also wears nose plugs made of plastic.</p>
